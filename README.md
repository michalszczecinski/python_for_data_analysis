# python_for_data_analysis
Repository with training materials for introduction to Python for Data Analysis.

## Learning objectives


This Notebook is created as a document supporting introduction and demonstration of Python for data analysis.
First part provides a basic introduction with motivations for using python and explaining its landscape for scientific computing. Second part is a rapid demonstration on various functions of Pandas library. Focus is on showing whats possible and prodivind example code snippets that can be tried and studied deeper later.

We will cover:

**1. How to automate common data analysis and data manipulation tasks.**   
So there in no need to do manual data upload, cleaning, pivot tables to aggregate or do vlookups to join the data.

**2. How to perform sophisticated analysis functions.**   
Timeseries analysis, filling missing data, dropping duplicates, descriptive statistics etc in seconds with few lines of code.

**3. How to create a reproducible analysis.**     
So you can rerun it with same parameters or create multiple follow up versions easily. When there is a sudden change no need to repeat whole process again, you can just rerun analysis code with the new assumptions,

**4. How to visualise and share insights directly from the source of the analysis.**    
No need to waste time copy-pasting analysis output to ppt decks !

**5. How to share and collaborate on analysis together with the data team.**   
Can ask data team for notebooks, tweak them and collaborate together.
